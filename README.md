# Assignment-7: Exploring R packages

### Package title: camtrapR

###Location: 
### ---To install this package you can install the release version of camtrapR from CRAN:
### install.packages("camtrapR")
### or the latest GitHub version (containing recent changes and new features) via:
### install.packages("remotes")
### install.packages("R.rsp")
### remotes::install_github("jniedballa/camtrapR", build_vignettes = TRUE)

### Vignette(s):
### The package has 5 formal vignettes that help users navigate it.
### 1. Organising raw camera trap images in camtrapR
### 2. Species and Individual Identification
### 3. Data Extraction from Images and videos, creating occupancy & secr input
### 4. Data exploration and visualisation
### 5. Multi-species occupancy models

###Application(s):
### The camtrapR package has been used in a wide range of conservation and research projects. For example, the Wildlife Conservation Society has used it for monitoring and research projects relating to camera trap data as they use it to process and analyze camera trap data. The package has also been used by researchers at the Smithsonian Institution. They studied the distribution and abundance of large mammals in tropical forests. There are other applications of this package, all demonstrating that it can help analyze camera trap data and estimate parameters such as density, abundance, and behavior of wildlife species.

### Review
### The ‘camtrapR’ package is a very useful tool for analyzing camera trap data. This package contains a set of functions that can be used to process, analyze, and visualize camera trap data. It is designed to handle challenges associated with camera trap data including missing data and repeated detections. I like that this package is a comprehensive set of functions that are important for the type of data I’m working with as it is very messy in nature. It contains functions that will help me do my analysis including estimating animal abundance, occupancy, activity patterns, and it can also help plot and visualize that data. The documentation and vignettes associated with this package are also very thorough and provide detailed explanations of the functions, their parameters, and examples. As a beginner to this type of camera data analysis, I find this package to be very helpful. Because I haven't spent much time working with this package, I still don't know if there any changes I'd like to see associated with this package, but I think it has been relatively easy to learn compared to other packages. Overall, I would recommend this package to anyone working with camera trap data, as it provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and analyzing data.
